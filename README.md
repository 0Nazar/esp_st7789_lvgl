# _Cube project_
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application running on an ESP32 microcontroller, designed to drive an ST7789 TFT display using the LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) framework. The project enables rendering of basic graphics and text, with support advanced GUI features such as buttons, sliders, and more. Additionally, sensors and an encoder integrated to enhance interactivity and functionality.



## Hardware Requirements

ESP32 Development Board (e.g., ESP32 DevKitC)

ST7789 TFT Display (240x240 resolution)

External Power Source (as required by your setup)

Rotary Encoder: For user input

Sensors: (e.g., temperature, humidity)

Buzzer: To notify system operation

Fun: To control the air outlet from the machine
